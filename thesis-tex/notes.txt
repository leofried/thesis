Introduction:
    What is a Tournament (entire season is a tournament)
    Survey of Literature
    Roadmap of paper (including key adjectives like ordered, faithful, etc)
    Formalizing Tournaments (Definitions)


Brackets:
    --Write Randomized Cohort Seeding
    --Alined, B-line, and C-lined

Multibrackets:
    --Multibracket : think really hard about definition, both readability and accuracy (and use "multibracket rule") as it applies to swiss->last structural theorem
            --> maybe this should be the priority thing, followed by a pile of theorems (corollaries?) for the inequality rules.
    
    --Swiss
    --Multiple Elimination
    --Properties (respectfulness, rematches [swapping], orderedness etc, why can we remove semitrivial)
    --make sure we know that teams can start in lower brackets (worried this might be shocking -- nba play-in does this i suppose, but maybe do rugby?)
    --do semibracket.tex examples still track

Round Robins:
    --Intro
    --Scheduled Formats (impure)
    --Tiebreakers
    --Faithfulness
    --Pools
    --Pool Extensions (seeding, variants (playing games outside of pools (nfl) power pools, wildcards (formal e.g. 13 and informal e.g. mlb)), "finishing pool play")
    --Impure 
        (play too few [ramsey theorem, two different seven play four, etc])
        (play too many [double round robin])
        (ramsey theorem, two different seven play four, divisions, mlb, soccer ties, etc)
    

Ideas:
    --Merge sort as a format for min/games faithfulness



Statistics and Applications:
    Accurate: Good E[winner_skill]
    Balanced: P[W[Spot]] = 1/n
    Ordered: i < j -> P[W[t_i]] \geq P[W[t_j]]
    Invariant: Stable under rearranging other teams (is this the same as holds its own under det-sym?)
    Rewarding: Probability best preforming team wins
    Exciting: Prob championship game, 1v2, etc.
    Aligned: Winning never makes your P[win] go down.
    Faithful: If P(a beats b) is always 1 or 0, then top-m in a RR is also top-m here
    Quad ball Formats (club sports? regionals?)

Hierarchy of Formats:
    --Format Equality
    --Format Counting
    --Random, det/sym/aligned, etc.

Conclusion:
    Suggestions for real formats (deserving-ness vs goodness)
