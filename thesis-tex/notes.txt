TOURNAMENT FORMATS:
    Define matchup tables

BRACKETS
    Proper Brackets:
        Use teams names rather than city
        should i-seed definition be in tournament formats/definitions

    Ordered Brackets:
        fidelity open question
        mlb playoffs are bad

ALTERNATIVE SEEDINGS
    Reseeding:
        finish proofs

    Cohort Randomized Seeding:
        Tennis seeding was to avoid rematches

        Literal Tennis is ordered (conj)
        For balanced bracket: 2^n-1+1 - 2^n is ordered (conj)
        Tiers based on chalky number of rounds survived is ordered (conj)
        
        Complete randomization is not always ordered (ref)
        But it is for balanced brackets (ref)
        In general, tiers by number of byes is ordered (conj)
        And for nearly (or nearly, nearly, etc) (conj)
        
        Finally, if something is ordered then 2^n of those brackets with tiers of size 2^n is ordered.

        General result about what makes something non-ordered (OQ)

MULTIBRACKETS
    --Simple Multibrackets
    --Properness
    --Rematches
    --Multiple Elimination (recharge rounds, bets of 2n+1s)
    --Semibrackets (and efficiency) [replay rounds OQ]
    --Swiss



    Simple Multibrackets:
        Also though, is proper seeding always right? optimized for odds to win the top tourney rather than lower ones. This is a multibracket thought? Proposal!

        When to call multibrackets simple

        Should we be enumerating multibrackets or something?

        split this section into two?

        talk more about properness and the fundamental theorem: when you squint, etc, etc.

    Semibracket Section:
        Note that some games aren't relevant.
        Introduce semibrackets
        Introduce multibrackets
        introduce swiss
        note that swiss paring methods can be different
        swiss can be viewed as a multibracket
        Introduce Efficient Multibrackets
        Cool that multibrackets unify a bunch of different things
        max_game_min_round theorem
        semibrackets being ordered?

    Multiple Elimination Section:

        Double Elimination 
        Recharge Rounds
        Triple Elimination [general combining scheme]
        Best of (2n+1)s

    Rematches Section:
        Thoughts about rematches and how to avoid them. 
        Replay round if we have a spare game?
        Can we just cancel the 2nd vs 3rd match if its a rematch




Rest of the book:
    Introduction:
        What is a Tournament (entire season is a tournament)
        Formalizing Tournaments
        Survey of Literature
        Balanced and Proper / terms? statistical terms??
        gameplay functions being: symmetric, consistent, SST

    Round Robins:
        --What they are
        --Tiebreakers
        --Scheduling
        --Impure (ramsey theorem, divisions, mlb, soccer ties, etc)
        --Combinatorial tournaments (zeroth tiebreaker[?])

    Space of Formats
        --Hierarchy
        --Det-Symmetric correspondence (3 team puzzle)
        --Next game based on winner or team (rr-type vs bracket-type)
        --Multilevel formats (pool play in particular, how to seed it, etc [possibly this its own section?])
        --Formats are a optimization
        --Formats are a Bayesian update
        --What real sports leagues do / recommendations {mlb, drafted opponents}

    Statistics
        Accurate: Good E[winner_skill]
        Balanced: P[W[Spot]] = 1/n
        Ordered: i < j -> P[W[t_i]] \geq P[W[t_j]]
        Invariant: Stable under rearranging other teams
        Rewarding: Probability best preforming team wins
        Exciting: Prob championship game, 1v2, etc.

        Appendix/Examples

Style:
    pick notation letters/brackets of sigs/tiers/tiered-sigs
    colon before figures?
    section header pages
    once I finish brackets I should email everyone
    shorthand for \P[t_i wins \A] and \P[t_i beats t_j] {P() vs P[]} -> done by hand in reseeding
    standardize induction on $r$ language
    successor signature?
