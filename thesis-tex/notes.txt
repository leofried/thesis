Round Robins:
    --What they are
    --Tiebreakers
    --Scheduling
    --Impure (ramsey theorem, two different seven play four, divisions, mlb, soccer ties, etc)
    --Combinatorial tournaments (zeroth tiebreaker[?])
    --Pool Play (definition, variants (power pools, wildcards (formal e.g. 13 and informal e.g. mlb)))

Hierarchy of Formats:
    --Format Equality
    --Format Counting
    --Random, det/symm/aligned, etc.

Statistics:
    Accurate: Good E[winner_skill]
    Balanced: P[W[Spot]] = 1/n
    Ordered: i < j -> P[W[t_i]] \geq P[W[t_j]]
    Invariant: Stable under rearranging other teams
    Rewarding: Probability best preforming team wins
    Exciting: Prob championship game, 1v2, etc.
    Aligned: Winning never makes your P[win] go down.
    Faithful: If P(a beats b) is always 1 or 0, then top-m in a RR is also top-m here
