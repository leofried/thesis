TOURNAMENT FORMATS:
    Define matchup tables

BRACKETS
    Bracket Signatures:
        successor signature

    Proper Brackets:
        Use teams names rather than city
        should i-seed definition be in tournament formats/definitions

ALTERNATIVE SEEDINGS
    Reseeding:
        finish proofs

    Tiered Seeding:

    Palandromic Algorithm:
        clean up
        $\F$ should be $\Pal$ or something [same with $\Order$]

    Cohort Randomized Seeding:
        Tennis seeding was to avoid rematches

        Literal Tennis is ordered (conj)
        For balanced bracket: 2^n-1+1 - 2^n is ordered (conj)
        Tiers based on chalky number of rounds survived is ordered (conj)
        
        Complete randomization is not always ordered (ref)
        But it is for balanced brackets (ref)
        In general, tiers by number of byes is ordered (conj)
        And for nearly (or nearly, nearly, etc) (conj)
        
        Finally, if something is ordered then 2^n of those brackets with tiers of size 2^n is ordered.

        General result about what makes something non-ordered (OQ)

MULTIBRACKETS
    [[IN general, how do we want to think about respectfulness and properness language]]

    Simple Multibrackets:
        When to call multibrackets simple 
        
        rigorously define the notion of weakly proper

        rematches

        split this section into two?

        talk about the opening bracket not being seeded
        alternative seeding proposal (reverse properness?)

        Notion of a "perfect" multibracket: {swiss cares about this}
            -- strongly respectful
            -- proper
            -- rematch hesitant
            -- very weak respectful -> same round loss means same semibracket (!!!! for swiss)

        [[sort out pics]]

    Semibracket Section:
        max_game_min_round theorem??
        copy over proper weak and strong respectfulness?
        enumeration of things?

    Swiss
        better definition
        reply rounds
        swiss avoid rematches?
        better diagrams
        shorter/more concise proofs
        appendix with 4-round compact swisses.

    (needs writing) Multiple Elimination:
        Double Elimination 
        Recharge Rounds
        Triple Elimination [general combining scheme]
        Best of (2n+1)s
        swapping parallel opponents

UGLY THOUGHTS:
    --Weakly Respectful (same tier -> same byes, same bracket)
    --Strongly Respectful (same tier -> same path)
    --Weakly Proper (better tier -> >= byes, >= bracket)
    --Strongly Proper (proper and better tier -> better seed) [[unclear if this is actually good]]
    --Not silly (a_{i, r_i} \neq 0 -> i_r = 0)
    --Something about rematches

    {
        Proper Tiers:
        Proper definition
        Reasons it doesn't work / compensation
        Strong respectfulness means properness is great
        but the fundamental theorem is great -- if you assume   teams in a give around are equally good
    }


Rest of the book:
    Introduction:
        What is a Tournament (entire season is a tournament)
        Formalizing Tournaments
        Survey of Literature
        Balanced and Proper / terms? statistical terms??
        gameplay functions being: symmetric, consistent, SST

    Round Robins:
        --What they are
        --Tiebreakers
        --Scheduling
        --Impure (ramsey theorem, two different seven play four, divisions, mlb, soccer ties, etc)
        --Combinatorial tournaments (zeroth tiebreaker[?])

    Space of Formats
        --Hierarchy
        --Det-Symmetric correspondence (3 team puzzle)
        --Next game based on winner or team (rr-type vs bracket-type)
        --Multilevel formats (pool play in particular, how to seed it, etc [possibly this its own section?]) {    dropping into the same bracket/wildcard games?}
        --Formats are a optimization
        --Formats are a Bayesian update [fidelity]
        --What real sports leagues do / recommendations {mlb, drafted opponents [purpose of seeding: reward good or deserving]}

    Statistics
        Accurate: Good E[winner_skill]
        Balanced: P[W[Spot]] = 1/n
        Ordered: i < j -> P[W[t_i]] \geq P[W[t_j]]
        Invariant: Stable under rearranging other teams
        Rewarding: Probability best preforming team wins
        Exciting: Prob championship game, 1v2, etc.

        Appendix/Examples

Style:
    pick notation letters/brackets of sigs/tiers/tiered-sigs
    colon before figures?
    section header pages
    once I finish brackets I should email everyone
    shorthand for \P[t_i wins \A] and \P[t_i beats t_j] {P() vs P[]} -> done by hand in reseeding
    standardize induction on $r$ language
    successor signature?
    where to put commas, ands, and bullets for lists in definitions
    "we say" for definitions? in general how to label adjective definitions. USe the noun in the title?
