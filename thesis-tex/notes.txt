Introduction:
    What is a Tournament (entire season is a tournament)
    Survey of Literature
    Roadmap of paper (including key adjectives like ordered, faithful, etc)
    Formalizing Tournaments (Definitions)

Brackets:
    --Write Randomized Cohort Seeding
    --Alined, Bline, and Clined

Multibrackets:
    --Properties (respectful, rematches, etc)
    --Swiss
    --Multiple Elimination
    --Orderedness (re:Maskin)

Round Robins:
    --What they are
    --Tiebreakers
    --Scheduling
    --Impure (ramsey theorem, two different seven play four, divisions, mlb, soccer ties, etc)
    --Combinatorial tournaments (zeroth tiebreaker[?])
    
Pools:
    (definition, variants (power pools, wildcards (formal e.g. 13 and informal e.g. mlb)))

Statistics and Applications:
    Accurate: Good E[winner_skill]
    Balanced: P[W[Spot]] = 1/n
    Ordered: i < j -> P[W[t_i]] \geq P[W[t_j]]
    Invariant: Stable under rearranging other teams (is this the same as holds its own under det-sym?)
    Rewarding: Probability best preforming team wins
    Exciting: Prob championship game, 1v2, etc.
    Aligned: Winning never makes your P[win] go down.
    Faithful: If P(a beats b) is always 1 or 0, then top-m in a RR is also top-m here

Hierarchy of Formats:
