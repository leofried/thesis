TOURNAMENT FORMATS:
    Flesh out introduction
    Define matchup tables

BRACKETS
    Bracket Signatures:
        successor signature

    Proper Brackets:
        Use teams names rather than city
        should i-seed definition be in tournament formats/definitions

ALTERNATIVE SEEDINGS
    (write) Reseeding

    (write) Palandromic Algorithm:
        clean up a lot
        $\F$ should be $\Pal$ or something [same with $\Order$]

    (write) Cohort Randomized Seeding:
        Tennis seeding was to avoid rematches

        Literal Tennis is ordered (conj)
        For balanced bracket: 2^n-1+1 - 2^n is ordered (conj)
        Tiers based on chalky number of rounds survived is ordered (conj)
        
        Complete randomization is not always ordered (ref)
        But it is for balanced brackets (ref)
        In general, tiers by number of byes is ordered (conj)
        And for nearly (or nearly, nearly, etc) (conj)
        
        Finally, if something is ordered then 2^n of those brackets with tiers of size 2^n is ordered.

        General result about what makes something non-ordered (OQ)

MULTIBRACKETS

    (write) Multiple Elimination:
        Double Elimination 
        Recharge Rounds
        Triple Elimination [general combining scheme]
        Best of (2n+1)s
        swapping parallel opponents
        Replay rounds?

Rest of the book:
    Introduction:
        What is a Tournament (entire season is a tournament)
        Formalizing Tournaments
        Survey of Literature
        Balanced and Proper / terms? statistical terms??
        gameplay functions being: symmetric, consistent, SST

    Round Robins:
        --What they are
        --Tiebreakers
        --Scheduling
        --Impure (ramsey theorem, two different seven play four, divisions, mlb, soccer ties, etc)
        --Combinatorial tournaments (zeroth tiebreaker[?])

    Space of Formats
        --Hierarchy
        --Det-Symmetric correspondence (3 team puzzle)
        --Next game based on winner or team (rr-type vs bracket-type)
        --Multilevel formats (pool play in particular, how to seed it, etc [possibly this its own section?]) {    dropping into the same bracket/wildcard games?}
        --Formats are a optimization
        --Formats are a Bayesian update [fidelity]
        --What real sports leagues do / recommendations {mlb, drafted opponents [purpose of seeding: reward good or deserving]}

    Statistics
        Accurate: Good E[winner_skill]
        Balanced: P[W[Spot]] = 1/n
        Ordered: i < j -> P[W[t_i]] \geq P[W[t_j]]
        Invariant: Stable under rearranging other teams
        Rewarding: Probability best preforming team wins
        Exciting: Prob championship game, 1v2, etc.

        Appendix/Examples

Style:
    pick notation letters/brackets of sigs/tiers/tiered-sigs
    colon before figures?
    section header pages
    once I finish brackets I should email everyone
    shorthand for \P[t_i wins \A] and \P[t_i beats t_j] {P() vs P[]} -> done by hand in reseeding
    standardize induction on $r$ language
    successor signature?
    where to put commas, ands, and bullets for lists in definitions
    "we say" for definitions? in general how to label adjective definitions. USe the noun in the title?
    when to italicize new words
