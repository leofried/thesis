Statistics and Applications:
    Accurate: Good E[winner_skill]
    Balanced: P[W[Spot]] = 1/n
    Ordered: i < j -> P[W[t_i]] \geq P[W[t_j]]
    Invariant: Stable under rearranging other teams (is this the same as holds its own under det-sym?)
    Rewarding: Probability best preforming team wins
    Exciting: Prob championship game, 1v2, etc.
    Aligned: Winning never makes your P[win] go down.
    Faithful: If P(a beats b) is always 1 or 0, then top-m in a RR is also top-m here
    Quad ball Formats (club sports? regionals?)

Hierarchy of Formats:
    --Format Equality
    --Format Counting
    --Random, det/sym/aligned, etc.
