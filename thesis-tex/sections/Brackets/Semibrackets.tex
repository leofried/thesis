    \begin{definition}{Semibracket}{}
        A \textit{semibracket} is a set of brackets that are played concurrently such that no team plays in more than one bracket.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}{Order}{}
        The \textit{order} of a semibracket is the number of brackets it contains.
    \end{definition}

    All brackets are already semibrackets of order one. You can easily transform a bracket into a semibracket of order two by not playing the championship game.

    Likewise, a bracket can be transformed into a semibracket of order four by not playing the semifinals or the finals. Semibrackets can be somewhat pathological like this semibracket of order four.

    \fig{1}{pathalogical_semibracket.png}{Pathological Semibracket of Order Four}{pathological}

    In the semibracket in Figure \ref{fig:pathological}, three teams must play no games to win their repesctive brackets, while six other teams compete to win the final bracket.

    The empty semibracket is the unique semibracket of order zero.

    The ideas of properness and signatures that we used to discuss brackets are also useful when applied to the space of semibrackets, so we port them over.

    \begin{definition}{Proper Semibracket}{}
        A \textit{proper semibracket} is a semibracket that has been properly seeded.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}{Semibracket Signature}{}
        The \textit{signature} of a semibracket is a list of integers of length $r + 1$, where $r$ is the number of rounds in that semibracket, such that the $i$th position in the list denotes the number of teams that play their first game in that round.
    \end{definition}

    We omit the proofs for brevity, but all of the important theorems about proper brackets and bracket signatures have semibracket analogues.

    \begin{lemma}{}{}
        In a proper semibracket bracket, if $m$ teams have a bye in a given round, those teams must be seeds $1$ through $m$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{lemma}{}{}
        If a proper semibracket goes chalk, then after each round the $m$ teams remaining will be the top $m$ seeds.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{lemma}{}{}
        In a proper semibracket, if $m$ teams have a bye and $k$ games are being played in a given round, then if the semibracket goes chalk those matchups will be seed $m + i$ vs seed $(m + 2k + 1) - i$ for $i \in \{1, ..., k\}.$
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{theorem}{}{}
        Each semibracket admits at most one proper seeding.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}{}{semisigsum}
    Let $\A = \bracksig{a_0; ...; a_r}$ be a list of integers. Then $\A$ is a semibracket signature of order $z$ if and only if $$\sum_{i=0}^r a_i \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{r - i} = z.$$
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}{}{}
        There is exactly one proper semibracket with each semibracket signature.
    \end{theorem}

    The only analogue theorem that has been changed by more then just adding the semi- prefix is Theorem \ref{th:semisigsum}. The semibracket version notes that the signature of a semibracket sumproducts with powers of $\frac{1}{2}$ to the order of the semibracket, rather than just to $1.$

    Finally, as an example, let's use these theorems to draw the semibracket $\bracksig{2;5;3;0},$ which has order $3.$
