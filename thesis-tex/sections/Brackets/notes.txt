Tiers:
    Notion of properly respectful seeding
    Is proper shape always right? Is there a better one?
    Fidelity open question
    
Cohort Randomized Seeding:
    Tennis seeding was to avoid rematches

    Literal Tennis is ordered (conj)
    For balanced bracket: 2^n-1+1 - 2^n is ordered (conj)
    Tiers based on chalky number of rounds survived is ordered (conj)
    
    Complete randomization is not always ordered (ref)
    But it is for balanced brackets (ref)
    In general, tiers by number of byes is ordered (conj)
    And for nearly (or nearly, nearly, etc) (conj)
    
    Finally, if something is ordered then 2^n of those brackets with tiers of size 2^n is ordered.

    General result about what makes something non-ordered (OQ)

    Reseeding

Simple Multibrackets:
    Also though, is proper seeding always right? optimized for odds to win the top tourney rather than lower ones. This is a multibracket thought

    When to call multibrackets simple in Section 2.6

    Should we be enumerating multibrackets or something?

Semibracket Section:

    Note that some games aren't relevant.
    Introduce semibrackets
    Introduce multibrackets
    introduce swiss
    note that swiss paring methods can be different
    swiss can be viewed as a multibracket
    Introduce Efficient Multibrackets
    Cool that multibrackets unify a bunch of different things
    max_game_min_round theorem
    semibrackets being ordered?

Multiple Elimination Section:

    Double Elimination 
    Recharge Rounds
    Triple Elimination [general combining scheme]
    Best of (2n+1)s

Rematches Section:
    Thoughts about rematches and how to avoid them. 
    Replay round if we have a spare game?
    Can we just cancel the 2nd vs 3rd match if its a rematch
