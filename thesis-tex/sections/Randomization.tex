    \begin{definition}{Totally Randomized Bracket}{}
        A \i{totally randomized bracket} is a traditional bracket except the teams are randomly placed onto the starting lines instead of being placed according to seed.
    \end{definition}

    This randomization means that the shape of a totally randomized bracket uniquely defines it. There is a no notion of two totally randomized brackets having the same shapes but different seedings, as the teams are randomly placed in the bracket the beginning of the format.

    Chung and Hwang conjectured that all totally randomized brackets were ordered \cite{define_ordered}. After all, the teams are all being treated identically: how could a better team be at a disadvantage relative to a worse one?
    
    \begin{conj}{}{randord}
        All totally randomized brackets are ordered.
    \end{conj}

    Indeed, Lemma \ref{th:rand_lemma} seems to provide some evidence for the conjecture. %proved by someone

    \lemm{}{
        Let $\A$ be a totally randomized bracket with signature $\bracksig{a_0; ...; a_r}$, let $\S$ be a list of teams, and let $\T$ be the list of teams produced by replacing a given team $s \in \S$ with a team $t$ such that for all other teams $u,$ $$\G{t}{u} \geq \G{s}{u}.$$ Then, $$\W{\A}{t}{\T} \geq \W{\A}{s}{\S}.$$
    }{
        Let $X$ be the set of subsets of $\S \setminus \{s\} = T \setminus \{t\}$, and for each set of teams $Y \in X$, let $P_Y$ be the probability that $s$ or $t$ will have to beat exactly the set of teams $Y$ in order to win the format (noting that this probability is the same for $s$ and $t$). Then,
        \begin{align*}
            \W{\A}{t}{\T} &= \sum_{Y \in X} \left(P_Y \cdot \prod_{u \in Y} \G{t}{u}\right)\\
            &\geq \sum_{Y \in X} \left(P_Y \cdot \prod_{u \in Y} \G{s}{u}\right)\\
            &= \W\A s\S
        \end{align*} 
    }{rand_lemma}

    
    Unfortunately, despite the lemma, Conjecture \ref{conj:randord} turns out to be false. This was first shown by Israel with the following counterexample \cite{seventeen_team}.

    \fig{1}{17teams}{The Proper Bracket Shape of Signature $\bracksig{16;0;0;0;1;0}$}

    \theo{}{
        The totally randomized bracket whose shape is the proper bracket shape of signature $\bracksig{16;0;0;0;1;0}$ is not ordered.
    }{
        Let $\A$ be the format in question, and let $\T$ be the list of seventeen teams containing one copy of each of $t_1, t_3, t_4,$ and $t_5,$ and thirteen copies of $t_2$ with the following matchup table.

        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c | c c c c c c c}
    & $t_1$ & $t_2$ & $t_3$ & $t_4$ & $t_5$\\ 
    \hline
    $t_1$ &  &  &  &  & \\
    $t_2$ & $0.5$ &  &  &  & \\
    $t_3$ & $0$ & $2p$ &  &  &  \\
    $t_4$ & $0$ & $p$ & $2p$ &  & \\
    $t_5$ & $0$ & $p$ & $p$ & $0.5$ & \\
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

        Let $i \in \{4, 5\}$ and let $j = 9-i.$ For $t_i$ to win $\A$ without getting placed on the red starting line, they must win at least four games against teams $t_1$, $t_2$, or $t_3$, which happens with probability $O(p^4).$ Thus we let $\B_i$ be the format identical to $\A$ except we enforce that $t_i$ will be placed on the red starting line and note that
        $$\W{\A}{t_i}{\T} = \frac{1}{17}\W{\B_i}{t_i}{\T} + O(p^4).$$
        
        Now $t_j$ reaches the finals of $\B_i$ with probability $O(p^4)$, $t_3$ reaches the finals of $\B_i$ with probability $O(p^3)$ and so $t_i$ beats them in the finals with probability $O(p^4)$, and of course $t_i$ cannot beat $t_1$ in the finals. Thus,
        \begin{align*}
            \W{\B_i}{t_i}{\T} &= p \cdot \P{\textrm{$t_2$ reaches the finals of $\B_i$}} + O(p^4).
        \end{align*}
        Since $t_3$ and $t_j$ reach the finals of $\B_i$ with probability $O(p^3)$ and $O(p^4)$ respectively,
        \begin{align*}
            \W{\B_i}{t_i}{\T} &= p \cdot \P{\textrm{$t_1$ doesn't reach the finals of $\B_i$}} + O(p^4).
        \end{align*}

        Assume now without loss of generality that $t_1$ gets placed on the orange starting line.\\

        Any difference in $\P{\textrm{$t_1$ doesn't reach the finals of $\B_i$}}$ between $i \in \{4, 5\}$ will have to come as a result of a game involving $t_j$ (as $t_j$ is the only difference in $t_1$'s route to the finals between $\B_4$ and $\B_5$), and because $t_4$ and $t_5$ have the same probability of beating every team other than $t_3$, it will have to be as a result of a game against $t_3.$ However, because neither $t_3$ nor $t_j$ can beat $t_1$, in order to play each other in a game whose winner doesn't immediately play $t_1$, they will have to be placed on two colored starting lines of the same color.\\

        If $t_3$ and $t_j$ are placed on two of the light blue or dark blue starting lines, then any difference in $\P{\textrm{$t_1$ doesn't reach the finals of $\B_i$}}$ between $i \in \{4, 5\}$ will be induced by $t_j$ winning its first three games, with happens with probability $O(p^3).$\\

        However, if $t_3$ and $t_j$ are placed on the two dark green or two light green starting lines, then when $i = 4$, $t_1$  will play $t_2$ in the yellow game with probability $$p_{35}p_{23} + p_{53}p_{25} = ((1-p)(1-2p) + (p)(1-p)) = 1-2p+p^2,$$ while when $i = 5$, $t_1$ will play $t_2$ in the yellow game with probability $$p_{34}p_{23} + p_{43}p_{24} = ((1-2p)(1-2p) + (2p)(1-p)) = 1-2p+2p^2.$$
        Thus, \begin{align*}
            &\P{\textrm{$t_1$ plays $t_2$ in the yellow game of $\B_5$}}\\
            - \;&\P{\textrm{$t_1$ plays $t_2$ in the yellow game of $\B_4$}}\\
             = \;&cp^2 + O(p^3)
        \end{align*}
        for some constant $c$, so
        \begin{align*}
            &\P{\textrm{$t_1$ doesn't reach the finals of $\B_5$}}\\
            - \;&\P{\textrm{$t_1$ doesn't reach the finals of $\B_4$}}\\
             = \;&cp^2 + O(p^3)
        \end{align*}
        for some constant $c$, so
        $$\W{\B_5}{t_5}{\T} - \W{\B_4}{t_4}{\T} = cp^3 + O(p^4)$$
        for some constant $c$, so
        $$\W{\A}{t_5}{\T} - \W{\A}{t_4}{\T} = cp^3 + O(p^4)$$ for some constant $c.$\\

        Therefore $\A$ is not ordered.
    }{}

    Chung and Hwang's conjecture was rescued by Chen and Hwang who restricted the domain of the claim to balanced formats \cite{totally_random_balanced}.

    \theo{}{
        All totally randomized balanced brackets are ordered.
    }{
        Let $\A_r$ be the totally randomized balanced bracket on $2^r$ teams. We induct on $r$. Clearly the one-team format $\A_0$ is ordered. For any other $r$, let $\T$ be a list of teams, and let $t_i$ and $t_j$ be teams such that $i < j.$\\

        Let $\B_r$ be the totally randomized balanced bracket on $2^r$ teams except $t_i$ and $t_j$ are forced to play each other in the first round, and let $\C_r$ be the totally randomized balanced bracket on $2^r$ teams except $t_i$ and $t_j$ cannot play each other in the first round. Then,
        $$\W{A_r}{t_i}{\T} = \left(\frac{1}{2^r-1}\right)\W{B_r}{t_i}{\T} + \left(\frac{2^r-2}{2^r-1}\right)\W{C_r}{t_i}{\T}$$ and likewise for $t_j.$\\

        Because $p_{ij} \geq p_{ji}$, and by Lemma \ref{th:rand_lemma}, $\W{B_r}{t_i}{\T} \geq \W{B_r}{t_j}{\T}.$ Thus left is to show that $\W{C_r}{t_i}{\T} \geq \W{C_r}{t_j}{\T}.$\\
        
        For two other teams $t_a$ and $t_b$, let $M_{ab}$ be the set of $2^{r-1}-2$ team subsets of $\T \setminus \{t_i, t_j, t_a, t_b\},$ and for $\S \in M_{ab},$ let $P_\S$ be the probability that the teams in $\S$ all win their first-round games and none of them play any of $t_i, t_j, t_a,$ or $t_b$ in the first round.

        Now,
        \begin{align*}
            \W{C_r}{t_i}{\T} &= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t_a, t_b \in \T \setminus \{t_i, t_j\}} \sum_{\S \in M_{ab}} P_\S \cdot ((p_{ia}p_{jb} + p_{ib}p_{ja}) \cdot \W{A_{r-1}}{t_i}{\S \cup \{t_i, t_j\}}\\
            &+p_{ia}p_{bj} \cdot \W{A_{r-1}}{t_i}{\S \cup \{t_i, t_b\}}+p_{ib}p_{aj} \cdot \W{A_{r-1}}{t_i}{\S \cup \{t_i, t_a\}})\\
            &\geq \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t_a, t_b \in \T \setminus \{t_i, t_j\}} \sum_{\S \in M_{ab}} P_\S \cdot ((p_{ia}p_{jb} + p_{ib}p_{ja}) \cdot \W{A_{r-1}}{t_j}{\S \cup \{t_i, t_j\}}\\
            &+p_{ja}p_{bi} \cdot \W{A_{r-1}}{t_j}{\S \cup \{t_j, t_b\}}+p_{jb}p_{ai} \cdot \W{A_{r-1}}{t_j}{\S \cup \{t_j, t_a\}})\\
            &=\W{C_r}{t_i}{\T}
        \end{align*}

        The inequality follows by comparing each term to its corresponding term: the $\W{A_{r-1}}{t_i}{\S \cup \{t_i, t_j\}}$ inequality is by induction, while the other two terms are by Lemma \ref{th:rand_lemma}.\\

        Thus, $\A_r$ is ordered.
    }{balance_ord}

    Chen and Hwang also conjectured that Theorem \ref{th:balance_ord} could be extended to totally randomized nearly balanced brackets as well, but this remains an open question.

    \begin{definition}{Nearly Balanced}{}
        A bracket is \i{nearly balanced} if no team receives more than one bye.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{conj}{}{trnbbo}
        All totally randomized nearly balanced brackets are ordered.
    \end{conj}

    Conjecture \ref{conj:trnbbo} would be a nice strengthening of Theorem \ref{th:balance_ord}: unlike balanced brackets, there is a nearly balanced bracket for every number of teams. If the conjecture held, then total randomization would be a format that can provide orderedness to arbitrary numbers of teams $n$ without having $O(n)$ rounds, as the traditional and reseeded options do.

    Of course, this orderedness does not come without drawbacks. For one, the randomization makes the orderedness feel a bit cheap: once the randomization is complete, before any games have even been played, the orderedness is lost. (Compare to the proper and reseeded ordered brackets, which maintain their orderedness throughout the whole tournament.)
    
    But secondly, total randomness has the undesirable property that it might make for some very lopsided and anti-climatic brackets. It could be that top-two teams, whom everyone wants to see face off in the championship game, are set to play each other in the first round!
    
    To fix this, we define a new class of randomized brackets: \i{cohort randomized brackets}, first defined by Schwenk \cite{randomized_cohort}.
    
    \begin{definition}{Cohort Randomized Bracket}{}
        The $r$-round \i{cohort randomized bracket} on is the traditional balanced bracket on $2^r$ teams, except, for each $i$, seeds $2^i + 1$ through $2^{i+1}$ are shuffled randomly before play.
    \end{definition}

    Thus the 1- and 2-seeds are locked into their places, the 3- and 4-seeds exchange places half the time, seeds 5-8 are randomly shuffled, and as are 9-16, 17-32, etc. 
    
    % An example of what a cohort randomized bracket might look after randomization is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:16rcb}.

    % \phig{16rcb}{The $16$-Team Cohort Randomized Bracket After Randomization}
    
    Cohort randomization solves the second issue with total randomness: that good teams might meet earlier than desired.
    
        \theo{}{
            If the $r$-round cohort randomized bracket goes chalk, after the $i$th round, the top $2^{r-i}$ seeds will remain. 
        }{
            We proceed by induction on $r$. If $r = 0$, then there are no rounds and so the theorem holds. For any other $r$, in the first round, the top $2^{r-1}$ seeds will face the bottom $2^{r-1}$ seeds, and because the format goes chalk, the bottom half of teams will be eliminated. Thus after the first round, the top $2^{r-1}$ seeds will remain. The remaining format is just the $r-1$-round cohort randomized bracket, for which the theorem holds by induction.
        }{}

    It seems as though cohort randomized brackets ought to be ordered: being in a higher cohort seems certainly preferable to being a lower cohort, as you delay confrontation with the other higher-cohorted teams until later, and if two teams are in the same cohort, they are treated identically and thus it seems that the better team would win more.

    Unfortunately, like many other formats we've seen thus far, cohort randomized brackets are not (for more than two rounds) ordered. 

    \fig{0.52}{eight_cohort}{Setup of Theorem \ref{th:cohort_counter}}

    \theo{}{
        The eight-team cohort randomized bracket is not ordered.
    }{
        Let $\A$ be the eight-team cohort randomized bracket, and let $\T$ have the following matchup table for $0 < p < 0.5.$
        
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c | c c c c c c c c}
    & $t_1$ & $t_2$ & $t_3$ & $t_4$ & $t_5$ & $t_6$ & $t_7$ & $t_8$\\ 
    \hline
    $t_1$ &  &  &  & & & & &\\
    $t_2$ & 0.5 &  &  &  & & & &\\
    $t_3$ & 0.5 & 0.5 &  &  &  & & &\\
    $t_4$ & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 &  &  & & &\\
    $t_5$ & $p$ & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 & & & &\\
    $t_6$ &  $p$&$p$  & $p$ &  $p$& 0.5 & & &\\
    $t_7$ & $p$ &  $p$& $p$ & $p$ & 0.5 &0.5 & &\\
    $t_8$ & $p$ &  $p$& $p$ & $p$ & 0.5 &0.5 &0.5 &\\
                \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

        Note that because $t_6, t_7,$ and $t_8$ each have identical matchups against every other team, permutations of those teams don't affect the probability of any other teams winning the tournament. Thus we consider the eight possible randomizations in Figure \ref{fig:eight_cohort} noting that for $i \in \{2, 3\},$
        $$\W{\A}{t_i}{\T} = \frac{1}{8}\sum_{j = 1}^8 \W{\A_j}{t_i}{\T}.$$
        (The three empty starting lines can be filled with any permutation of $\{t_6, t_7, t_8\}.$)\\

        Some calculation finds
        \begin{align*}
            \W{\A_1}{t_2}{\T} &= \W{\A_1}{t_3}{\T}\\
            \W{\A_2}{t_2}{\T} &= \W{\A_2}{t_3}{\T}\\
            \W{\A_3}{t_2}{\T} &= \W{\A_4}{t_3}{\T}\\
            \W{\A_4}{t_2}{\T} &= \W{\A_3}{t_3}{\T}\\
            \W{\A_6}{t_2}{\T} &= \W{\A_8}{t_3}{\T}\\
            \W{\A_7}{t_2}{\T} &= \W{\A_5}{t_3}{\T}\\
            \W{\A_8}{t_2}{\T} &= \W{\A_6}{t_3}{\T}
        \end{align*}
        However, letting $q = 1- p,$ $r = \frac{1}{2}q + \frac{1}{4},$ and $s = pq + \frac{1}{2}q$
        \begin{align*}
            \W{\A_5}{t_2}{\T} &= qs\left(q\frac{1}{2}+p(pr + qs)\right)\\
            &<qs\left(q\frac{1}{2}+p\left(\frac{1}{2}r + \frac{1}{2}s\right)\right) &\textrm{because $r < s$ and $p < \frac{1}{2} < q$}\\
            &=\W{\A_7}{t_3}{\T} 
        \end{align*}
        Thus, $$\W{\A}{t_2}{\T} < \W{\A}{t_3}{\T}$$ so $\A$ is not ordered.
    }{cohort_counter}

    If cohort randomized brackets don't solve the orderedness problem, why would we use them over traditional proper brackets? Cohort randomization is most famously found on the ATP Tour, a collection of tournaments played by professional tennis players that all use almost identical formats: large balanced brackets. Additionally, the seeding for these tournaments is set by the ATP rankings, which tend to be slow to update. As a result, if every ATP Tour tournament used the proper seeding, the 6-seed and 27-seed would play each other in the first round at every tournament until one of them moved up or moved down. These rematches were deemed undesirable and so this randomization procedure was introduced: The 1-seed's quarterfinals matchup (if everything goes chalk) is now randomly drawn from the 5- through 8-seeds, instead of always being the 8-seed.

    But Theorem \ref{th:cohort_counter} tells us that they are not ordered. Thus we are left with the following question: does there exist a bracket-like format with the property that
