\begin{definition}{Bracket}{}
    A \textit{bracket} is a tournament format in which teams are first placed in the leaves of a binary tree, and then games are successively played between teams in nodes that share a parent, placing the winner of each game in the shared parent node. At the end of the tournament, the entire tree will be filled out, and the team that has been in the root of the tree (which is the only team that has not yet lost a game) is declared champion.
\end{definition}

Brackets are traditionally stylized like so:

By the end of the tournament, the bracket would look like this:
